      If you are age 65 or older, the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit is a
      benefit you've earned! Medicare encourages this annual visit with a health
      provider as a valuable step to keep you active and independent for as long
      as possible. And, if you have traditional Medicare (also called Medicare
      Part B), the cost of the Annual Wellness Visit is covered at 100%,
      requiring no copay from you. During your Annual Wellness Visit, you will
      work with a Life Line Community Healthcare Nurse Practitioner to develop a
      personalized wellness plan that you will take with you that day. We will
      also send a copy directly to your doctor. The Nurse Practitioner will
      evaluate your current health status, identify your risk factors for
      chronic disease, and make a list of all the recommended Medicare
      preventive screenings you should receive for the next few years.
