      Our Mission
    </h2>
    <p class="text-blue-800 text-center font-semibold">
      Awareness and early detection of disease is powerful. Thatâ€™s why our
      purpose is to make you aware of unrecognized and potential health
      problems, and encourage follow-up care with your personal physician to
      strengthen their understanding of your total health.
